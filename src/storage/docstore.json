Answer: You can choose from the entire range of flights offered by all Lufthansa Group airlines.\n\nWhat if I have further questions or need support? Answer: You can contact our customer support team.\n\nOrdering an invoice\n\nIf you need an invoice for personal or business purposes, most countries accept an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice. For countries with special requirements, an invoice can be ordered using forms that are available for this purpose.\n\nUsing an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice Your e-ticket confirmation is internationally recognised as a receipt in most countries, including Switzerland, and it can be used for the reimbursement of expenses and for the submission of a tax return.\n\nYou can order your e-ticket confirmation in your profile under \u201cBookings\u201d via the link \u201cE-documents (Invoice)\u201d or via the link \u201c\u200bPassenger Receipt\u201d.\n\nOrdering an invoice after your booking If you find out at a later date that you require an invoice, we can send you a new booking confirmation free of charge up to 90 days after the ticket/document has been completely used. After this 90-day period, we charge a fee of CHF 30 for each confirmation (up to a maximum of five e-ticket confirmations).\n\nInvoices for Greece, India, Italy or Spain For flights originating in Greece, India, Italy or Spain, we can issue special invoices on request. You can request an invoice in these countries if the information provided on your e-ticket is not deemed sufficient.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nCard Security Number\n\nTo make your payments with credit or debit cards online even more secure, we require you to enter the card security number for online bookings. This code will check the validity of the credit/debit card information.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nIf you are using an American Express Card the security number is the 4 digit number shown above the credit card number on the front of the card.\n\nMasterCard\n\nIf you are using a Mastercard (credit card or debit card) the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\n\nVisa\n\nIf you are using a Visa card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\n\nDiners\n\nIf you are using a Diners card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\n\nJBC\n\nIf you are using a JCB card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\n\nChina Union Pay\n\nIf you use a China Union Pay credit card, you will find the 3-digit security number in the signature field on the back of your card.\n\nCard Security\n\nPayment security standards Based on a new EU directive on payment services, we have increased our payment security standards, which ensures an even safer environment for online transactions across European countries.\n\nWe follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which defines the rules for how we store, transmit and process payment data, particularly with regard to credit and debit card transactions. This also means that all your payment data is encrypted to the highest safety standards.\n\n3-D Secure authentication To further reinforce security, 3-D Secure authentication is now required for all credit and debit cards that are issued in the EU Economic Area (EEA). This additional step of authentication guarantees secure payments and reduces the risk of fraud.\n\nHow does the 3-D Secure process work? If you haven\u2019t done so yet, you will have to register your credit and debit card for this process.\n\nRegister via the website of the bank which issued your credit or debit card.

You must be over 18 years old and be a resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein. Furthermore, this payment option is only available for flights from Switzerland.\n\nWhat exactly does the ID scan check and where does this take place? The ID scan and comparison with a selfie prevents fraud and ensures that the person who booked the flight is the actual invoice recipient and that there has been no identity theft. For this purpose, you will receive a link via text message to your smartphone. You will be able to upload your documents and identify yourself via this link.\n\nDo I have to carry out the ID scan for every booking? No, once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not have to do it again for a later booking.\n\nWhy has my ID scan failed? Please note the following when carrying out an ID scan: The photographs should be sharp, well-exposed and avoid reflections. Do not cover the documents. Take a recent photograph of yourself.\n\nCan I repeat a failed ID scan? Yes, if your documents were not recognised, you may repeat the ID scan.\n\nWhat reasons could there be for not authorising the \u201cPay per invoice\u201d option? For \u201cPay per invoice\u201d, our partner POWERPAY carries out an online check. This check may have a negative outcome for a variety of reasons, such as creditworthiness, contradictory information or unpaid POWERPAY invoices. You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the \u200bPOWERPAY website.\n\nHow and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice? Invoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24\u201348 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement. You will receive this statement by post in the form of a monthly invoice approximately in the middle of the following month, together with a paying-in slip. The cost for issuing the monthly invoice is CHF 2.90.\n\nHow long is the payment period and how much are the reminder fees for non-payment? Individual invoice: The invoice must be paid within 15 days of receipt of the e-mail. Payment will be processed via online banking. Payments made at the post office counter incur third-party costs. Monthly invoice: The deadline for payment is always the end of the month with the paying-in slip. Is partial payment possible? Yes, partial payment is possible for both the individual and the monthly invoices. You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.\n\nWhen does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost? If the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\n\nHow do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket? This depends on when you make the cancellation.\n\nIf the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer. If SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending. If SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.", "start_char_idx": 11487, "end_char_idx": 16102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c4a93e-3015-4501-a1ad-93752f0ed9e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c4a93e-3015-4501-a1ad-93752f0ed9e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "output.docx", "file_path": "/mnt/c/Users/HP/Documents/customer-support-ollama_bind_tools/src/data/output.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 22767, "creation_date": "2024-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "442ed454-3615-47f1-99db-f18696b2592b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "output.docx", "file_path": "/mnt/c/Users/HP/Documents/customer-support-ollama_bind_tools/src/data/output.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 22767, "creation_date": "2024-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-22"}, "hash": "e5e59c619a9691ca0bca9f4163b71ddd425eedc70e706471d70fb15b41ee41a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a4cc3d8-21b7-4f1e-a127-cb5ac43609e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "output.docx", "file_path": "/mnt/c/Users/HP/Documents/customer-support-ollama_bind_tools/src/data/output.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 22767, "creation_date": "2024-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-22"}, "hash": "4a15f7bd8dbfe149f127f6594e4050f9fd7dc92229051bc43063ee898cf4bf28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad96d3a4-2089-490d-a0f3-e07ac4215f12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "477abf11a3211133ac1179fcd4c7c1f54e536626b96da63655b5210af255793c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\n\nHow do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?

If you have any queries about invoices, please contact POWERPAY\u2019s customer service.\n\nE-mail: info@powerpay.ch\n\nHotline: +41 58 806 06 22\n\nCustomer service is available Mondays to Fridays from 8:00 to 17:00 h.\n\nCan I give my business address for payments? Purchases on account can only be made on submission of your private address.\n\nFrequently asked questions: Payment\n\nWhat advantages do I have if I used the currency conversion option? Using the currency conversion option gives you the following advantages:\n\nYou decide which currency is to be charged to your credit card. The daily exchange rate is displayed, and is guaranteed for the payment. Credit card companies usually charge an additional fee for purchases in foreign currencies (foreign currency fee). This does not apply if you pay in the currency of your credit card.\n\nWho can benefit from the currency conversion option? The option to pay in a different currency is available only when booking through swiss.com.\n\nThe service cannot be used to change flights, for later upgrades or additional services (e.g.\u00a0additional baggage item etc.) or for ticket purchases made through different booking channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.\n\nWhat exchange rate is used for the conversion? The total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.\n\nThe exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.\n\nWill there be any other credit card charges? Some banks might charge additional fees in individual cases. SWISS has no influence over these charges.\n\nWhat currency is used for refunds? R\u00fcckerstattungen finden immer in der W\u00e4hrung des ausgestellten Tickets statt.\n\nFrequently asked questions: European fare concept\n\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked? No.\u00a0As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g.\u00a0Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)? The fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups? Group bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed? The additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares? Wenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, k\u00f6nnen Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enth\u00e4lt.

The number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything? Like the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken? No; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag? The 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition? The first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance.

Swiss Airlines offers different fare types, each with their own specific cancellation terms and conditions. The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your flight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply. If you cancel your Swiss Airlines flight outside of the 24-hour window, cancellation fees will be charged depending on your fare type and the time of cancellation. For example, if you cancel a non-flexible economy class ticket, a cancellation fee will be charged. The closer you cancel to the departure date, the higher the cancellation fee. In some cases, Swiss Airlines may allow you to make changes to your flight instead of cancelling it outright. However, these changes may also come with fees or penalties depending on your fare type and the type of change requested. If Swiss Airlines cancels your flight, you may be entitled to a full refund or rebooking on another flight. However, if the cancellation is due to extraordinary circumstances such as bad weather or political unrest, Swiss Airlines may not be obligated to offer any compensation. In summary, Swiss Airlines\u2019 cancellation policy varies depending on your fare type and the time of cancellation. To avoid any unnecessary fees or charges, it\u2019s important to familiarise yourself with the terms and conditions of your ticket and to contact Swiss Airlines as soon as possible if you need to make changes or cancel your flight.\n\nHow to Cancel a Swiss Air Flight?
